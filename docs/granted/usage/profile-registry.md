# Profile Registries

Sharing consistent AWS profiles amongst team members can be helpful. This allows you to adopt consistent role names across your documentation and scripts. For example: ”run your development deploys using the `cf-dev` role”.

To manage sharing profile configuration, Granted provides a Profile Registry. This feature utilizes a git repository as a central store for AWS profile configurations. Granted's Profile Registry synchronizes this to the default AWS config file located locally at `~/.aws/config`.

## Creating a Profile Registry

### Using Granted to configure a Profile Registry

#### Create a Profile Registry folder.

You can quickly copy the contents of your local `~/.aws/config` file to a Profile Registry repository with the following command:

```
granted registry setup
```

:::info
This will copy all profiles inside your `~/.aws/config` file to the Profile Registry's config file.
:::

This command outputs a `granted-registry` folder to your current working directory. This folder contains the following files:

```
├── .git
├── config
└── granted.yml
```

#### Add the local repository to your git-based version control tool.

The `granted-registry` repository will need to be manually added to your organization's version control tool. For GitHub, you can follow this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github#adding-a-local-repository-to-github-using-git).

## Adding a Profile Registry

You can add any git-based repository to Granted's Profile Registry. By default, Granted looks for a `granted.yml` file in the root of the repository. Should you wish to specify an alternative YAML file, [follow this guide](#specifying-a-different-yaml-file).

You can add a repository to Granted's Profile Registry by running the following command:

```
granted registry add -n <registry_name> -u <repository_url>
```

Here, flag `-name` or it's alias `-n` is required to identify the registry. 

The `granted.yml` file identifies AWS config files to be synced to Granted's Profile Registry. These config files must exist in the repository; paths pointing outside the repository such as `../config` are not permitted. Multiple config files are allowed and are merged together when syncing your local config file to the repository.

A valid `granted.yml` requires an `awsConfig` key to be present. For example:

```
awsConfig:
  - ./config
  - ./other-config
```

In the above example, AWS profiles inside `config` and `other-config` files will be merged and synced to your local `./aws/config` file.

:::info
If there are any duplicate profile names in the same repository, the latter will overwrite those former causing only unique profiles to be synced.
:::info

Adding a registry will manipulate your local `/.aws/config` file to include Granted autogenerated sections. Here's an example:

```
# Granted-Registry Autogenerated Section. DO NOT EDIT.
# This section is automatically generated by Granted (https://granted.dev). Manual edits to this section will be overwritten.
# To edit, clone your profile registry repo, edit granted.yml, and push your changes. You may need to make a pull request depending on the repository settings.
# To stop syncing and remove this section, run 'granted registry remove
[granted_registry_start granted-registry]

[profile dev]
sso_start_url  = <https://example.awsapps.com/start>
sso_region     = <your-sso-region>
sso_account_id = <your-sso-account-id>
sso_role_name  = <your-sso-role-name>

[granted_registry_end granted-registry]
```

:::info
To avoid confusion, synced profiles are placed into a designated region in the `/.aws/config` file as shown above. This allows users to have a mix of both synced and regular profiles in their config file:

## Optional Flags when Adding a Profile Registry

| Optional Flag             | Alias | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| path                      | p     | provide path if only the subfolder needs to be synced                       |
| filename                  | f     | provide filename if yml file is not granted.yml                             |
| priority                  |       | profile registry will be sorted by priority descending                      |
| prefix-all-profiles       | pap   | provide this flag if you want to append registry name to all profiles       |
| prefix-duplicate-profiles | pdp   | provide this flag if you want to append registry name to duplicate profiles |
| requiredKey               | r     | used to bypass the prompt or override user specific values                  |

## Usage: 
### Specifying an alternative YAML file.

Granted allows you to specify an alternative YAML file for your Profile Registry's configuration. Should you wish to specify a different YAML file, run:

```
granted registry add -n <registry_name> -u <your-repo-url> -f <file_name>
```

### Specifying only a subfolder

If you have subfolder such as:

```
.
├── team_dev
│   ├── config1
│   ├── config2
│   ├── granted.yml
│
├── team_ops
│   ├── config3
│   ├── config4
│   ├── custom.yml

```

Then you can specify only the subfolder containing a `granted.yml` file:

```
granted registry add -n <name> -u <your-repo-url> -p <relative_path_to_subfolder>
```

Or with custom file name as:

```
granted registry add -n <name> -u <your-repo-url.git> -p <relative_path_to_subfolder> -f <filename>
```

### Deterministic Deduplication Priority 

When syncing multiple registries they are synced by priority descending. The default Priority is 0. 
This lets users define which profile should have a registry name as prefix on profile duplication.

For example if you have Profile Registries A and B with shared profile name `develop` then profile with lower pririty will be prefixed with registry name.

## Variable Substitution in AWS profile 
If you want to template your AWS profile for user specific values or some re-useability then you can add `templateValues` in your config.yml file like:

```
awsConfig:
  - ./dev/config1
templateValues:
  - <YourKeyName>
    - ... 
  - BaseProfile: 
    - value: "my-profile"
  - SessionName: 
      - isRequired: true 
      - prompt: "Enter your user name (e.g john.doe)"
```

:::info
You can use `{{ .Profile }}` when templating and will be used to replace with the correct profile name
:::info


### User Specific Values 
For cases, when there are user specific values that are required by users to be enter for Profile Registry. You can add `isRequired:true` field to the keyName to define them as User Specific Values.

For example: If you want user to enter `session_name` then 

1. Add your template variable to config.yml file like:
```
awsConfig:
  - ...
templateValues:
  - SessionName: 
      - isRequired: true 
      - prompt: "Enter your user name (e.g john.doe)"
```

Your config file might look like:

```
[profile prod]
session_name = {{ .Required.SessionName }}
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/example
```

When templating, for user specific values you need to add `{{ .Required.<KeyName>}}` 

This will prompt user to add value for `SessionName` when granted registry add/sync command is run and will interpolate the template with the user provided value.

:::info
You can bypass the prompt by providing `-r` flag to granted registry add like: <br/>
`granted registry add -n <name> -u <url> -r "SessionName=JohnDoe"`
:::info


### Arbitary variables 
For cases when you want to reuse a variable for partial config files. You can add `value` to any keyName in `templateValues`.

1. Add your template variable to config.yml file like:
```
awsConfig:
  - ...
templateValues:
  - BaseProfile: 
      - value: "my-profile"
```
 

Your config file might look like:

```
[profile myacc]
source_profile = {{ .Variables.BaseProfile }}
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::0123456789012:role/readonly
```
 
When reusing values, you need to add `{{ .Variables.<KeyName> }}`. 

## Syncing a Profile Registry

Adding a Profile Registry is sufficient to sync the `granted.yml` config file. Once per day Granted will automatically sync the repositories contained within your Profile Registry. By default, this process will be invoked when you run `granted credential-process` or `asssume` commands.

Should you wish to invoke a manual sync, run:

```
granted registry sync
```

This will loop over the repositories associated with your Profile Registry and will pull the latest changes from the remote origin, performing a sync operation.

:::info
When using AWS CLI with `granted credential-process` you will not be notified of failed Profile Registry syncs. This occurs as AWS expects specific JSON STDOUT when configured with sourcing credentials with an external process. In that case, you can run `assume` or `granted registry sync` to view the issue. Add verbose flag like `assume --verbose` to view the debug logs.
:::info

## Removing a Profile Registry

To unsubscribe a repository from Granted's Profile Registry run the following command:

```
granted registry remove
```

This will display all repositories subscribed to Granted's Profile Registry and will prompt you to choose a repository to unsubscribe.

## Updating Profile Registry Configuration

Previously, Profile Registry didn't require passing `-n` or `-u` flag. However, the current version has some breaking changes so if you are already using Granted Profile Registry then run the following command to update your registry configuration.

```
> granted registry update 
```
