# Documentation styleguide

To keep our documentation consistent, keep the following in mind when making PRs:

- Granted should always be stylised as 'Granted', and not 'granted' in lowercase.

- AWS should always be capitalised.

- Use '123456789012' as an example AWS account when you need one.

- Don't use 'AWS Config' with a capital Config to describe the `~/.aws/config` file. AWS Config is a separate AWS service. Instead, refer to this file as the 'AWS config file' or 'your local AWS configuration file'.
